# Advent of Code 2022

- `yarn run day1` etc


## Notes

Days found difficult:

Day 7 - Test case passing, input data not. Difficult to hand-craft something that causes the problem. Might be related to nested dirs with the same name, can't remember.

Day 9 - Part 1 was OK but I struggled with part 2. Outputting the visual output was kinda useful. IIRC the movement algo had to change to allow for 2x2 moves. It was difficult keeping track of everything, since every move meant 10 * `number in move` simulations in a chain, plus start cases.
